1.) Get collision working correctly
    - We have a problem where the player bounding box is getting stuck in an obstacle
    - AABB vs SAT (separating axis theorem)

2.) Implement running

3.) GameMap (Data Structure)
    - Should act as a high-level (highest?) container for all entities

4.) Create a simple magic potion entity
    - Determine how to "inject" into GameMap at specified x,y coordinate

5.) Utilized corrected collision detection algorithm to allow player to loot based on proximity

6.) Need a backpack implementation to carry items
    - A form of listener will need to be developed

7.) Magic Potion is a consumable; implement the action for when player consumes this item

8.) Console or output pane (like combat log from WoW)
    - Priority 1: just get some standard output:
        (yellow) You loot 13 Silver, 80 Copper
    (dark green) You recieve loot: [Vrykul Bones]. ( <- bracketed item, including brackets, is white )
     (dark blue) Tallhorn Stag dies, you gain 79 experience. (+36 exp Rested bonus, -43 raid penalty)

9.) Design and implement acceleration / motion by point and click
